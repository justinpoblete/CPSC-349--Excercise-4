# In Class Assignment 4 Team Benchwarmers


### Introduction
  - This exercise is to be completed with your project teams. If you complete this exercise by yourself, you will not receive full credit. You may divide up the work between team members, consult the textbook and online references, discuss your work with other teams, and offer help to or accept help from members of your team and other teams, but the work submitted should be completed by the members of your team. This exercise is due by the end of class on July 22.
  
### Goal
  - Once all three forms have been created and tested, combine them into a single HTML page named index.html. Add Nav tabs to switch between the three forms.
  - Use a GitHub client (not dragging-and dropping into your web browser) to publish all four pages to a new public GitHub repository. Do not replace your GitHub Pages site or the contents of an existing repository. Write the URL for the new repository here:https://creative-yorkii.github.io/CPSC-349-01-Exercise-4/
